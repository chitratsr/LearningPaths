# Welcome to the Microsoft Artificial Intelligence and Research Team's Learning Paths

## How do these Learning Paths Work?
These documents will help you create a personalized learning journey for Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Services, and Machine Learning concepts.

Start by selecting the title that best fits who you are within a solution. These are the "Folders" within this site.

- Project Sponsor - Envisions, funds and starts the project
- IT Director - Manages the IT functions within an organization
- IT Architect - Deals with the components of a solution and how it integrates with your organization's IT ecosystem
- Data Scientist - Focused on Advanced Analytics
- Developer - From Mobile to Web Developers, AI Developers, R and Python coders

Within each Folder you'll find Learning Paths that cover an **Objective** you want to achieve - from learning how something operates to an actual, hands-on implantation, from samples to overviews.

Each **Objective** will have multiple **Concepts** you need to understand. Within each **Concept** are various **Resources** you can use to learn in a given order. And each **Resource** will pertain to one or more **Technologies**.

We'll make sure to include the *Level* of the **Resource**, and any *Pre-Requisites* you need to study the material. You can also copy out the list, and edit it to make it your own.

Here's an example:

| Objective |	Concept	| Resource | Technologies | Level | Pre-Requisites 
| --- |	---	| --- | ---  | ---  | --- 
| Develop an Intelligent Kiosk | Computer Vision| [Microsoft Vision API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) | Microsoft Cognitive Services | Intermediate | Web, Destop and API Programming
|  | Computer Vision| [Microsoft Face Detection](https://www.gitbook.com/book/buckwoody/microsoft-ai-and-research-learning-paths/edit#) | Microsoft Cognitive Services | Intermediate | Web, Destop and API Programming
